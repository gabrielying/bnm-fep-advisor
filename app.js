      {ref:'FAQ Q2',title:'Can a Resident exporter retain FC export proceeds overseas?',body:'No. The Resident exporter must repatriate into Malaysia the full value of export of goods proceeds, either in Ringgit or Foreign Currency (FC), within 6 months from the date of shipment. The proceeds can be retained in a Ringgit account or Trade FCA maintained with onshore banks.'},
      {ref:'FAQ Q3',title:'Does repatriation apply to export of services or merchanting trade?',body:'No, the repatriation requirement applies to export of goods only.

      {ref:'FAQ Q4',title:'Are toll manufacturing proceeds treated as export of goods?',body:'Yes.

      {ref:'FAQ Q5',title:'Is there a timeline to repatriate export proceeds?',body:'Yes. Export proceeds shall be repatriated immediately upon receipt of payment, which must be within 6 months from the date of shipment — so credit terms given to Non-Resident clients cannot exceed 6 months from the shipment date. This timeline can be extended up to 24 months for permitted reasons (see FAQ Q6) without prior approval from the FEP Authority. If proceeds remain outstanding after 24 months from shipment, the Resident exporter must notify the FEP Authority within 21 days after the end of each calendar year via https://bnm.my/fep.'},
      {ref:'FAQ Q6',title:'What are the permitted reasons for the 24-month repatriation extension?',body:'(a) The Resident exporter has no control over the delay in receiving proceeds, including: buyer in financial difficulties; buyer cancels, delays, disputes or does not respond to payment requests; FX restrictions in the buyer\'s country; quality and/or quantity claims; or incidence of fraud. (b) Credit terms of up to 24 months given by the Resident exporter for: consignment sale; or goods that involve testing and commissioning.'},
      {ref:'FAQ Q7',title:'Does this apply to individuals, sole proprietorships and partnerships?',body:'Yes, the export of goods requirements apply to all Residents including individuals, sole proprietorships and general partnerships — other than export of goods by a Resident individual for personal consumption.'},
      {ref:'FAQ Q8',title:'How is the 6-month repatriation period computed?',body:'It is calculated from the date of shipment. Example: invoice dated 5 Feb, shipment dated 5 Mar — if payment is received by 4 Sept (within 6 months of shipment), no approval from the FEP Authority is required. If payment is instead received on 5 Sept (after 6 months) and the delay is not due to a permitted reason, approval from the FEP Authority is required and the application must be submitted before the 6-month period expires.'},
      {ref:'FAQ Q9',title:'Can export proceeds be retained in FC after repatriation?',body:'Yes. A Resident exporter can freely retain any amount of export proceeds in FC in its Trade FCA maintained with a licensed onshore bank, or convert it to Ringgit according to its FC and Ringgit cash-flow needs.'},
      {ref:'FAQ Q10',title:'Is there a time limit on retaining FC proceeds in Trade FCA?',body:'No, there is no time limit on the retention of export proceeds in a Trade FCA.'},
      {ref:'FAQ Q11',title:'What offsetting and writing-off arrangements are approved?',body:'Export proceeds can be offset against the following FC obligations owed to a Non-Resident: (a) import of goods or services; (b) warranty claims; (c) dividend payments; (d) other Current Account Transactions (e.g. management fees); or (e) repayment of FC Borrowing — including global offsetting arrangements undertaken through the Resident exporter\'s Non-Resident treasury management centre (TMC). Export proceeds can also be written off where: (a) the Non-Resident buyer is in liquidation; or (b) the proceeds cannot be received from the Non-Resident buyer at least 24 months from the date of shipment despite following up.'},
